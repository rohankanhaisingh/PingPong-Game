# PingPong-Game
A simple pingpong game to show you the basics of the canvas 2D context. Feel free to use this code for your own projects, or to actually learn stuff!
I made this for fun. It is just a basic pingpong game to show you how it works. 

Download the zip file to get the files, they are safe.

I have some challenges for you if you are interested: 
 - Create a trail for the ball.
 - Play sounds when the ball hits the corners.
 - Create a multiplayer system using NodeJS.
 - Make a score system.
 - Do some cool UI stuff.
 
I already did these challenges so I am sure they are possible to do :).
Goodluck
